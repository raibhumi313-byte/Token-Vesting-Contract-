# Token Vesting Contract

## Project Description

The Token Vesting Contract is a Solidity-based smart contract that enables organizations to lock and gradually release ERC-20 tokens over a specified time period. This contract is designed to manage token distribution for team members, advisors, investors, or any stakeholders who should receive tokens on a vesting schedule rather than all at once.

The contract supports features like cliff periods (initial lock-up time before any tokens vest), linear vesting over a custom duration, and optional revocability for added flexibility in managing token allocations.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to provide a secure, transparent, and flexible token vesting solution that helps blockchain projects build trust with their communities. By ensuring that team members and early investors are committed for the long term, we reduce the risk of sudden token dumps and promote sustainable project growth.

We aim to become the go-to standard for token vesting in the Web3 ecosystem, offering a battle-tested, auditable smart contract that can be easily integrated into any token distribution strategy.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Vesting Schedules**: Create unique vesting schedules for each beneficiary with custom total amounts, cliff periods, and vesting durations
- **Cliff Period Support**: Implement an initial lock-up period before tokens begin to vest, ensuring long-term commitment
- **Linear Vesting**: Tokens vest linearly over time after the cliff period, providing predictable token releases
- **Optional Revocability**: Contract owner can revoke vesting schedules when marked as revocable, useful for employee terminations or breached agreements
- **Secure Token Release**: Beneficiaries can claim their vested tokens at any time through the `releaseTokens()` function
- **Transparency**: All vesting schedules and releases are tracked on-chain with emitted events
- **ReentrancyGuard Protection**: Built-in protection against reentrancy attacks
- **View Functions**: Query releasable amounts for any beneficiary without executing a transaction

## Future Scope

1. **Multi-Token Support**: Extend the contract to support vesting schedules for multiple ERC-20 tokens simultaneously
2. **Batch Operations**: Add functionality to create multiple vesting schedules in a single transaction for gas efficiency
3. **Flexible Vesting Curves**: Implement non-linear vesting schedules (exponential, step-based, milestone-based)
4. **Delegation Features**: Allow beneficiaries to delegate their vesting rights to other addresses
5. **Emergency Pause**: Add circuit breaker functionality to pause all token releases in case of security threats
6. **NFT Integration**: Issue NFT certificates representing vesting schedules that can be traded or transferred
7. **Governance Integration**: Allow DAO governance to approve or modify vesting schedules
8. **Analytics Dashboard**: Develop a front-end interface to visualize vesting schedules and track token releases
9. **Mobile Notifications**: Alert beneficiaries when new tokens become available for claiming
10. **Cross-Chain Support**: Extend functionality to work across multiple blockchain networks
